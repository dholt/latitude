This is a python app to update Google Latitude with your iPhone location.
It is based on the location class http://github.com/dholt/location/tree/master

Requirements:
* Mobile Me account with iPhone location services turned on
* iGoogle page with Google Latitude module

Usage:
* Create config.py
  Example config.py contents:

	# mobile me
	musername = 'username@me.com'
	mpassword = 'password'

	# gmail
	gusername = 'username@gmail.com'
	gpassword = 'password'
	
* Add latitude.py to your crontab:
  Example:
	chmod +x latitude.py
	# Every 30 minutes (careful, this can really drain your battery!)
	*/30 * * * * latitude.py

If you want a _good_ version of this concept, use 'playnice' http://github.com/natfriedman/playnice/tree/master
